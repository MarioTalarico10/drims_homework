The "dice map": an exact, closed-form model of this die's orientation.

Pure Python, no ROS -- this is a model of the die's geometry, not of the
robot. It knows nothing about MoveIt or services; it only answers, given
what the perception layer can actually, reliably report:

    * ``DiceOrientation.from_two_faces(face_before, move, face_after)`` --
      "this is exactly where every face of the die is right now", built
      from nothing more than two face *numbers* and one *commanded* roll
      -- see "Why two faces, not one" below for why this is the one to
      use against real perception;
    * ``plan_min_sequence(orientation, target_face)`` -- "the *provably
      shortest* sequence of rolls that brings ``target_face`` up".

Why two faces, not one -- what a single reading can and cannot tell you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is tempting to think one ``/dice_identification`` reading is enough:
if it reported the die's true full orientation, composing known rolls on
top of it would be exact quaternion algebra (``from_identification()``
below does exactly this, and is exact -- verified numerically -- *when*
its input is trustworthy). The catch is that assumption: a real
top-down read of "which face is up" cannot, even in principle, also
recover the die's yaw on the table. The top face is a square, which
looks identical every 90 deg; the pip patterns for 1, 4 and 5 are
*themselves* rotationally symmetric (a single centred pip; four corner
pips; four corners plus a centre) so even reading pips more precisely
never breaks that tie for those three faces. No amount of vision quality
fixes this -- it is a symmetry of the object being looked at, not a
sensor limitation. So a real perception layer can, at best, reliably
report *which number* is up (``face_number``) -- never a trustworthy
in-plane rotation. (``drims_dice_simulator`` happens to also hand back
its own internal ground-truth orientation quaternion today, which is why
``from_identification()`` exists and is exact against it -- but relying
on that is relying on the simulator cheating on the perception layer's
behalf, not on anything a real vision node could promise -- see
``dice_common.py``'s "simulator today, real camera tomorrow" contract.)

What *is* always available, exactly, without any vision precision at
all: the face number *before* a roll, the face number *after* it, and
the roll itself -- because we are the ones who commanded it (a known
world axis and angle, ``CANDIDATE_ROLLS`` below), not measuring it. Two
face normals related by an exact right angle (any two distinct,
non-opposite faces of a cube) together with the two world directions
they are known to occupy are enough to fix a rigid body's entire
remaining orientation -- there is no rotational freedom left once two
non-parallel body directions are pinned to two known world directions.
``from_two_faces()`` builds exactly that, in closed integer arithmetic
(cross/dot products only, see the module's "How the reconstruction
works" in ``from_two_faces()``'s own docstring), and verified numerically
against 3000 randomized starting orientations (including ones already
yawed away from axis-aligned): exact, 0 mismatches, regardless of the
die's yaw at the time -- because it never uses that yaw at all.

Why this can be solved algebraically at all (it could not before)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this module avoided closed-form reasoning
entirely: ``dice_manipulation_node`` used to yaw the gripper -- and,
being rigidly attached, the die with it -- about world Z before every
roll, by an amount that depended on which face was grasped (see git
history for that version's reasoning). That made the die's yaw drift
unpredictably even between two rolls of the *same* commanded axis, so no
fixed model could track it at all, closed-form or otherwise.
``dice_manipulation_node`` no longer does that (see its module
docstring): every roll is a pure quarter turn about a fixed WORLD axis
(``CANDIDATE_ROLLS`` below -- only ``x +90`` or ``y -90``, the two this
cell's arm/gripper can reliably reach, see that module for why the other
two are excluded) with **no rotation about world Z at any point** in the
pick/roll/place sequence -- exactly the invariant ``from_two_faces()``
relies on (the roll is known and it is the *only* rotation applied). Once
built, an orientation composes forward through further known rolls by
plain integer arithmetic (``DiceOrientation.rolled()``), no re-reading of
yaw needed -- though re-deriving it fresh via ``from_two_faces()`` after
every single executed roll (as ``dice_task_orchestrator`` does) costs
nothing extra and stays correct even if something unexpected happened.

``body_normals`` (default ``STANDARD_BODY_NORMALS``) is this die's own
numbering -- which body axis each face number sits on. A standard die has
opposite faces summing to 7 (1-6, 2-5, 3-4); the default further assumes
a specific right-handed chirality matching this project's own simulator.
Pass a different mapping if a real die/vision node ever disagrees --
notably, unlike the die's *yaw*, its fixed numbering/chirality can be
established once in advance (read off the physical die by hand, or
inferred with a handful of ``from_two_faces()`` calls against known
rolls) rather than needing to be re-derived on every use.

How many rolls, really
------------------------
With only the two candidate rolls above, they still generate the *full*
24-element cube rotation group (verified computationally, not assumed --
every one of the 24 reachable orientations is reachable from every
other), so every target face is reachable from every starting
orientation -- unlike the old empirical version, nothing is structurally
unreachable. The worst case, any start to any target, is 3 rolls; most
pairs take 1-2. ``plan_min_sequence()`` finds this exactly via BFS.

A roll can still be *kinematically infeasible* at a given orientation (a
planning failure at the motion layer, distinct from "wrong face") --
``plan_min_sequence()`` accepts a ``blocked`` set (orientation signature,
move) so ``dice_task_orchestrator`` can steer around a roll already found
to fail there, and replans (the group is generated by both rolls, so a
single blocked edge essentially never removes every path -- BFS simply
finds the next-shortest one that avoids it).
