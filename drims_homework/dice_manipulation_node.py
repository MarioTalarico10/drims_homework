Dice manipulation node — the reusable pick / roll / place *skill*.

Given the dice on the table (localized through ``/dice_identification``,
see ``dice_common.py``), a single ``~/pick_rotate_place`` call:

    1. moves home, opens the gripper, identifies the dice;
    2. picks it from above -- grasp yaw aligned with the live ``dice_tf``
       *and* pre-rotated (before ever touching the die, see "Why the
       grasp yaw is picked before grasping" below) so the jaws already
       line up with the world axis the roll is about to turn around;
    3. lifts it straight up (still attached);
    4. rolls it a quarter turn about that fixed world axis while, in the
       same move, carrying it to a fixed, known-safe table spot (see "Why
       release always happens at a fixed spot");
    5. descends and releases right there, retreats;
    6. re-identifies the dice to report the new face-up number.

Throughout all of this the die is never rotated about world Z, at any
point, by any amount -- not during the grasp (the yaw that lines the
jaws up happens before contact, see below), not during the roll (which
is always exactly about world X or world Y), not at release. This is a
deliberate invariant, not an incidental property: it is what keeps a
roll's outcome exact, closed-form, integer arithmetic instead of an
empirical guess -- see ``dice_face_map``'s module docstring for the
planning consequence (the die's full six-face layout is known exactly
from one *executed* roll and the two face numbers around it -- real
perception cannot promise more than that, see "Why two faces, not one"
there -- and every subsequent minimal roll sequence is a proven BFS
minimum, not a discovered one).

The *smart* logic that decides **which** roll gets the die to a desired
number is intentionally NOT here — that is ``dice_task_orchestrator``,
using ``dice_face_map``. This node only executes one roll at a time.

Design notes (each earned by an actual failure while building this)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why roll near the table, not at a distant "home" configuration.**
Carrying the dice all the way to ``home_joints`` and back for every
single quarter turn is a long, unrelated excursion for what should be a
small, local action. Rolling "in place" (pinning the exact pick-time
Cartesian *XY* while swinging the wrist ~90 deg) regularly hit
``NO_IK_SOLUTION`` — too demanding for a 6-DoF arm. ``roll_dice()``
instead combines the rotation with a translation to ``release_position``
(see below) in the very same move, at lift height: the solver gets to
choose a sensible path through both changes together, rather than being
pinned to the pick-time XY while also swinging the wrist.

**Why the roll is about a FIXED WORLD axis** (``roll_axis`` = ``'x'`` or
``'y'``), not the die's own body axis. An earlier, die-body-relative
version made the wrist sweep a *different* physical motion every time,
depending on the die's landing yaw — occasionally near a wrist
singularity, unpredictably. A world-fixed axis means a given roll is
always the same physical wrist motion, so a direction that turns out to
over-rotate the wrist can be permanently excluded once (see
``dice_face_map.CANDIDATE_ROLLS``) instead of rediscovered per face.

**Why the grasp yaw is picked before grasping, not after.** The gripper
must open with its jaws horizontal at release, so the dice actually
falls/settles instead of being released at a tilted angle -- and since a
world-axis roll leaves that axis's own line fixed, jaws that start out
parallel to the *upcoming* roll axis stay exactly parallel to it all the
way to release. The jaws close along the tool's local X axis, and the
grasp itself must stay flush with the die's *actual* live yaw (real
physical grasping, not a scripted attach) -- but because the die is
always axis-aligned at pick time (see the module docstring's invariant:
nothing here ever yaws it), ``dice_tf``'s own X/Y axes are *always*
exactly parallel to world X/Y, never at some arbitrary in-between angle.
That means the jaws can be brought parallel to either world axis with an
exact 0 or 90 deg choice, decided from the already-known live ``dice_tf``
orientation and the already-known upcoming ``roll_axis`` (the
orchestrator sets it via ``set_parameters`` before this call even
starts) -- entirely on paper, before the gripper ever moves.
``pick_dice()`` folds this straight into the grasp approach pose itself:
the gripper is open and clear of the die throughout approach and
descent, so choosing its yaw there costs no extra motion and, unlike the
old post-lift alignment step this replaces, never touches the die's own
orientation at all -- only the still-open gripper's pose changes.

Because the die is consequently *never* yawed about world Z by anything
in this sequence -- not at grasp, not during the roll, not at release --
a given ``(orientation, roll_axis)`` roll's resulting face is exact,
closed-form geometry, not something that has to be learned by trial —
see ``dice_face_map``'s module docstring for the planning consequence
(the full six-face layout is known after a single
``/dice_identification`` reading, and every face is reachable from every
orientation, worst case 3 rolls).

**Why release always happens at a fixed spot** (``release_position``,
a world (X, Y) configured per cell), never wherever the dice happened to
be picked up from. The dice can be found anywhere within the perception
layer's spawn/detection area, which may be close to a table edge or a
cell barrier (see ``drims_cells``' URDF safety barriers); opening the
gripper there risks the gripper body itself colliding with something
right at the moment of release. Picking is unavoidably wherever the dice
actually is — but nothing requires releasing there too. ``roll_dice()``
folds the trip to ``release_position`` into the roll itself (one
combined rotate+translate move, not two), so this costs no extra motion
over the earlier "roll near the pick spot" design, while removing the
edge-collision risk entirely. Where exactly the dice lands within the
next perception cycle does not matter for correctness either way — the
*next* ``pick_rotate_place()`` call always re-reads the dice's actual
position fresh — so centralizing it is a pure safety win.

**Why position/orientation come from captured or just-commanded values,
never a fresh TF lookup mid-sequence.** While the dice is away from the
table, the simulator only refreshes ``dice_tf``/``dice_com_tf`` on its
own ~0.5s "gravity" timer, so a lookup shortly after a move can return a
stale value indistinguishable from "still resting on the table". This
node instead only ever uses: a value read once via a synchronous
request/response (``/dice_identification`` at the very start of the
call), or a value it just commanded itself (if ``move_to_pose`` reports
success, the tool really is there, within tolerance — no read-back
needed).

Interfaces
----------
* Service ``~/pick_rotate_place`` (``std_srvs/srv/Trigger``): runs the
  sequence once with the currently configured ``roll_axis`` /
  ``roll_angle_deg`` and returns a short report (old face -> new face).
* Parameter ``run_on_start`` (bool): also run once at start-up.
